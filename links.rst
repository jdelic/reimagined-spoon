A Collection of Links
=====================

Here is a list of articles and useful information that informed my current
views about how I work and how I lead.


About Company Culture
---------------------
1. `The Culture Deck`_ A manifesto about servant leadership and how important
   company culture really is to everything.

2. `Culture Eats Strategy for Breakfast`_ The title alone says everything you
   need to know about how important fostering culture is.


About work
----------
1. `Kanban for Everyone`_

2. `Spotify Engineering Culture Part 1 <sec_1_>`_ and `Part 2 <sec_2_>`_

3. `Programmer, Interrupted <programmer_>`_. "A programmer is likely to get
   just one uninterrupted two-hour session in a day". This results of this
   study inform many of my views about `asynchronous communication <slack_>`_
   and why you should never interrupt someone when another mode of
   communication suffices and is available.

4. `Decisions and who owns them`_ by my friend Kristian Glass distills how we
   should act when a decision was delegated.

5. `Words of Estimative Probability <wep_>`_ points you toward better
   communication practices for expressing uncertainty.

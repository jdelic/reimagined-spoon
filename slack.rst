every CTO/Head of <anything>/Team lead, I have my own thoughts about what
constitutes effective use. This document contains those thoughts.


Asynchronous communication is a quick win for any IT organization
-----------------------------------------------------------------
It seems to be widely ignored, but for years now, scientifically there have
been indications that open plan offices are *not* facilitating positive 
communication, good practices or better knowledge sharing, or at least only at
the cost of serious drawbacks. For more context, you can refer to:

* `When the walls come down`_ 
* `Why we still believe in private offices <Private Offices Redux_>`_
* The book Peopleware by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister
* Everything that `Joel Spolsky`__ 
  has written on the topic <Private Offices Redux>`__ (and really any other
  topic as well)

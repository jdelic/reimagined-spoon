Asynchronous communiation
=========================

People use every communication tool differently everywhere and like
every CTO/Head of <anything>/Team lead, I have my own thoughts about what
constitutes effective use. This document contains those thoughts.


Asynchronous communication is a quick win for any IT organization
-----------------------------------------------------------------
It seems to be widely ignored, but for years now, scientifically there have
been indications that open plan offices are *not* facilitating positive 
communication, good practices or better knowledge sharing, or at least only at
the cost of serious drawbacks. For more context, you can refer to:

* `When the walls come down`_ 
* `Why we still believe in private offices <Private Offices Redux_>`_
* The book Peopleware by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister
* Everything that `Joel Spolsky`_ 
  `has written on the topic <Private Offices Redux_>`_ (and really any other
  topic as well)
    
Instead, we can safely say, that every synchronous communication
interaction also incurs a huge cost. In my mind, there are only two roles when
I interrupt what you are doing at your desk: perpetrator and victim.

Phone call                 Chat tools
Walking over to your desk  Email
Walking into your office   Ticket system
Shouting across the room   A post-it left on your desk

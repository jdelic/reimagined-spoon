Asynchronous communication
==========================

People use every communication tool differently everywhere and like
every CTO/Head of <anything>/Team lead, I have my own thoughts about what
constitutes effective use. This document contains those thoughts.


Asynchronous communication is a quick win for any IT organization
-----------------------------------------------------------------
It seems to be widely ignored, but for years now, scientifically there have
been indications that open plan offices are *not* facilitating positive
communication, good practices or better knowledge sharing, or at least only at
the cost of serious drawbacks. For more context, you can refer to:

* `When the walls come down`_
* `Why we still believe in private offices <Private Offices Redux_>`_
* The book Peopleware by Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister
* Everything that `Joel Spolsky`_
  `has written on the topic <Private Offices Redux_>`_ (and really any other
  topic as well)

Instead, we can safely say, that every synchronous communication
interaction also incurs a huge cost. In my mind, there are only two roles when
I interrupt what you are doing at your desk: perpetrator and victim.

=========================    ============================
Synchronous communication    Asynchronous communication
=========================    ============================
Phone call                   Chat tools
Walking over to your desk    Email
Walking into your office     Ticket system
Shouting across the room     A post-it left on your desk
=========================    ============================

So when in doubt, always choose an asynchronous way of communicating, unless
you need to communicate something urgent.


"Fail Open"
-----------
**"If you have no explicit obligation or reason to keep something to yourself,
choose the best available asynchronous, non-disruptive communication method
available that allows the most people to participate if they want to or
inform themselves after the fact."**

Let's unpack the above statement:

* Obviously some things in a company need to be kept secret. Some information
  is protected by law (employment information, customer information, etc.) and
  some information is volatile to the company (downsizing discussions,
  employee performance).
* But generally, it's much better to discuss anything openly, but in such a way
  that it doesn't disrupt other peoples' work.
* So in that case, open a Slack channel, open a ticket, create a collaborative
  mindmap or wiki page and pull in the people needed to work on it, but make
  the process, the discussion and the result widely available.


Slack channels are cheap
------------------------
**When in doubt, open a channel.**

We run `destalinator`_. This is a bot that will reap unused Slack channels and
keep everything tidy and clean up after you. On the other hand that means that
we can open Slack channels for everything and use them as long as we need them
and it makes sense to keep them. So never worry about opening a Slack channel
too many.
